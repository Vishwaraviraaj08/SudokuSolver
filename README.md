# SudokuSolver
This code is a Java program that solves a Sudoku puzzle using backtracking algorithm.

The program asks the user to input a 9x9 Sudoku grid, where 0 indicates an empty space. It then uses a recursive solve() method to fill in the empty spaces in the grid. The solve() method works by iterating through each empty space, trying out numbers 1 to 9, and checking if each number is valid in that position using the isValid() method. If a number is valid, it moves on to the next empty space and repeats the process. If a number is not valid, it backtracks to the previous empty space and tries a different number. If it is unable to find a valid number for a space, it returns false, indicating that the puzzle cannot be solved.

The isValid() method checks if a number is valid in a given row, column, and 3x3 subgrid by checking if there are no other occurrences of the number in the same row, column, or subgrid.

Once the solve() method has successfully filled in all the empty spaces, the program prints out the solved grid using the printGrid() method. If the solve() method was unable to solve the puzzle, the program outputs a message saying that the puzzle cannot be solved.
